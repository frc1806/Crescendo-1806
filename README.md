# Crescendo-1806
FRC Team 1806's 2024 Robot Code


Note: At the current moment there isn't a YAGSL 2024 release yet but the 2024 code is open sourced so at the moment we have the `swervelib` folder for YAGSL located in `src/main/java/swervelib` until an official vendordep is released. Also the YAGSL config is currently placeholder values until we have an actual 2024 practice bot to use
